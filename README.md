# Source code for 9 LED raindrops display.

The Tiny85_TLC5940.h, which implements a workable interface to the
TLC5940 chip, came from the
[HeartThrob](http://www.open-electronics.org/hack-your-valentine-with-heartthrob/)
source code.  I think it was written by
[Vicenza Thunders](https://twitter.com/VicenzaThunders).

The rest of the code is just some simple stuff to make somewhat
pleasing visual patterns on a 3D printed lamp.
